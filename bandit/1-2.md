# Bandit 1-2

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

## Solution  
The challenge involves reading a file named `-`, which is problematic
because `-` is a reserved symbol in Unix (it represents standard input/output).
Hereâ€™s how to solve it:

1. **Use the full path**
    ```bash
    cat ./-
    ```

2. **Input Redirection**
    ```bash
    cat < -
    ```
