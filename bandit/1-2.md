# Bandit 1-2

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called - located in the home directory

## Solution

At the first moment I tried ```cat -``` but that failed. The prompt cursor went to
the next line and waited for my input.

So I checked the cat manual and there's the following line:

**With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.**

Problem detected. The cat is reading from standard input.
Now we have some options to work around it.

- 1. Use full location of the file
```cat ./-```

- 2. Redirect the file's content
```cat < -```
