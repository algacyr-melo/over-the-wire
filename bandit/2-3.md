# Bandit 2-3

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename
located in the home directory

## Solution

At this time I typed ```cat spaces``` then I hit tab key so the shell auto completed
the filename.

*It's important to highlight how the spaces could be handled:*

- 1. Escaped
```cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename```

- 2. Quoted
```cat "spaces in this filename'```
