# Bandit 2-3

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called
**spaces in this filename** located in the home directory.

## Solution
When you encounter filenames with spaces, the shell will misinterpret
them as separate arguments unless handled properly.
Here's how to resolve it:

1. **Tab Completion**
    Type `cat spaces` and press `<TAB>` to auto-complete the filename:
    ```bash
    cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
    ```

2. **Handling Spaces**
    - Escaped Spaces:
        ```bash
        cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
        ```
    - Quoted Filename:
        ```bash
        cat "spaces in this filename"
        ```
