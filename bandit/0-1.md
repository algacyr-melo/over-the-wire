# Bandit 0-1

## Description
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home
directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH.

## Solution

This level is pretty straightforward. I just listed(ls) the home directory
then I concatenated(cat) the readme file to STDOUT.
